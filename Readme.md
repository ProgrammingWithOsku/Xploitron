## üöÄ About Xploitron

Xploitron is a penetration testing tool designed to automate the discovery of web application vulnerabilities. It leverages **Playwright** for robust, headless browser automation and a local **Large Language Model (LLM)** for intelligent, context-aware payload generation. Its modular architecture allows for easy expansion with new attack types.

-----

## ‚ú® Key Features

  * **Dynamic Input Discovery:** Automatically finds and tests all input fields, text areas, and search bars on a page.
  * **Recursive Crawling:** Intelligently spiders the target site to discover all in-scope pages, respecting the initial domain and port.
  * **Modular Attack Engine:** Built with a clean separation of concerns, allowing for new modules (e.g., SQLi, LFI) to be easily added.
  * **AI-Powered Payloads:** Connects to a local LLM (via Ollama) to generate creative and effective attack payloads.
  * **Robust Automation:** Intelligently handles common obstacles like cookie consent popups and detects CAPTCHAs to avoid getting stuck.
  * **Secure, Single-File Reporting:** Generates a clean, self-contained HTML report with detailed results of every attack attempt.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

  * **Node.js** (v18 or later)
  * **npm**
  * A local **Ollama** instance running with your chosen model (e.g., `ollama run llama3`).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd xploitron
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure the scanner:**
    Open `src/core/config.ts` and set your desired `TARGET_URL`, `SCAN_MODE`, and `MODEL_NAME`.

    ```typescript
    // src/core/config.ts
    export const TARGET_URL = 'http://localhost:4000/';
    export const MODEL_NAME = 'llama3';
    export const SCAN_MODE: 'recursive' | 'single' = 'recursive';
    ```

### Running the Scan

Execute the main script to start the scan:

```sh
npm start
```

After the scan is complete, the report will be saved in the `/results` directory.

-----

## üîß Configuration

All settings are centralized in `src/core/config.ts`:

  * **`TARGET_URL`**: The entry point for the scan.
  * **`MODEL_NAME`**: The name of the model to use with your local Ollama instance.
  * **`SCAN_MODE`**:
      * `'single'`: Scans only the `TARGET_URL`.
      * `'recursive'`: Crawls and scans the entire website starting from the `TARGET_URL`.
